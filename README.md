# NGS1_project
final project

this project aimed to apply sequence alignment on DNA 
a study was done on different patients with desmoid-type fibromatosis
The sample used in this project collected from patient 8 in this stdy
id for bioproject PRJNA604749
id for DNA run SRR11014546	
samples were sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2500 systems for single read of 50bp producing FASTAQ file. fastq file was downloaded and used for alignment on blastn aganist whole human genome which was downloaded from ENA of EMBl-EBI
blast output was parsaed to detect that aren't unique and did a secondary alignment
also GC % and mean MAQC were calculated and ploted using softwares and commands lines
conda package was used to install different sofwares through special environment called NGS1
